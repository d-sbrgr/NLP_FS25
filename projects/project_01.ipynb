    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vocabulary/Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "* I decided to use the **FastText** library for this project, since in class it was said that FastText is superior to the other embedding models and there is no problem with embedding unknown words, because it can create word vectors from their subwords. Furthermore, I will be working with the **facebook/fasttext-en-vectors** word vectors from the HuggingFace hub. They embed words from the English language, which is the only relevant language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This choice influences decisions in the following pre-processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Format cleaning (e.g. html-extracted text)\n",
    "\n",
    "* No format cleaning is performed, because we work with a carefully assembled and standardized dataset used in model benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "* *word_tokenizer* from the **nltk** library will be used. This tokenizer works well for the English language. It also splits punctuation from text, which matches the tokens the fasttext word vectors were trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lowercasing, stemming, lemmatizing, stopword/punctuation removal\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lowercasing**: Although the word vectors in use were trained on case-sensitive data, the tokenized words will be lowercased to reach a smaller vocabulary and minimize out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "* **Stemming**: The word embedding model was not trained on word stems and therefore no stemming is carried out.\n",
    "* **Lemmatizing**: The word tokens to be embedded will not be lemmatized, because the fasttext model was trained on un-lemmatized words and the n-gram encoding of the words used in fasttext preserves sub-word information.\n",
    "* **Stopword/Punctudation removal**: Since the task is to answer common-sense questions, stopwords and punctuation will not be removed. Most of the questions are quite short and the loss of information if either a critical stopword in the question or punctuation that changes the meaning of the question is removed could be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removal of unknown/other words\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since I am working with a fasttext model, the removal of unknown words is not necessary, because vectors for them can implicitly be built from their n-gram vectors. Also, the encounter of unknown words is not expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input will not be truncated. After some data review, the question yielding the most embedded word vectors yields a tensor of shape **300x67**. Depending on the input format, the RNN model will have to perform significantly less than 100 time steps for the longest input, which is deemed to be feasible. Also, if padding is implemented correctly, for every timestep only the necessary amount of time steps will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Of the available features, the **question**, the **choices** and the **answerKey** were chosen. While the *questionConcept* seemed like an interesting feature at first, after some data review it was determined, that this feature often simply contains a word from the question. In the end this feature was left out in order not to give too much emphasis to a single word that does likely not help answering the question at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input format: how is data passed to the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I chose the input for the *Classifier Model* to be a tensor of size **1800**. The first 300 elements are the averages of the embedded question tokens, next are 300 elements for every embedded and averaged answer vector from answer option 'A' to 'E'.\n",
    "      * The average of the question vectors was chosen, because it is a good tradeoff between information retention and input  dimension for the classifier.\n",
    "      * The question vector is before the answer vectors, because \"Q&A\" also has question first, then answers.\n",
    "      * The answers are arranged from 'A' to 'E' because of alphabetical order.\n",
    "      * The average of the answer embeddings has been chosen, since answers can consist of multiple words and therefore may yield multiple embedding vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### RNN + Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I chose the input for the *RNN + Classifier Model* to be tensor of size **300 x (N + 10)**. The first *N* columns of the tensor are the word-embeddings of the question. The last *10* columns are the averages of the word embeddings for each answer choice, separated by a *SEP* token.\n",
    "      * As separation token the character **¦** was chosen, because it is known to the embeddings model, but does not appear in the data.\n",
    "      * The separation token was introduced to signal to the model, that after the input after this reserved token is an answer choice.\n",
    "      * All answer embeddings are concatenated to the question embeddings to only need one full pass through the RNN model to get a prediction.\n",
    "      * The answer embeddings are after the question embeddings, because \"Q&A\" also has question first, then answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Label format: what should the model predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both model architectures will predict a vector of length 5. Every answer choice ('A' through 'E') is encoded on an index in the vector (0 through 4). Since the classifier at the last stage of the model predicts the likelihood of each output, this output format seems the most reasonable. Also, with this kind of output, the model only needs to run once for every classification, which should increase compute performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train/valid/test splits\n",
    "\n",
    "* As seen in the *Introduction* section, the train/validation/test splits are performed as defined in the course\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batching, padding\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each model, before training the batch size is determined at which 80% of GPU memory is being used. This threshold was chosen, because the GPU is well utilized, but there is still room for unforseen memory usage.\n",
    "    * Note: For the classifier model, the entire training data sit would fit on the GPU memory at once. The batch size for that model will be statically set at **512**. Reason: Still use stochastic gradient descent with around 16 batches in total.\n",
    "* Only the input of the **RNN + Classifier** model is of variable size, therefore padding is only necessary for that model. #TODO: specify padding for RNN model"
